## Introduction

Materials Science is a multidisciplinary field

Ex: Silica exists as SiO2, needed material science to turn it into pure Si

### Important Terms

- Composition
  - Refers to elemental composition
    - "What is this shit made of"
  - Water: H2O

## Principles of Basic Chemistry (Revision)

### Structure of the Atom

- Protons, Neutrons, Electrons
  - Electrons must equal Protons
- Atomic Number
  - ex: Atomic Number 26 is Fe
- Atomic Mass ($A_r$) (g/mol)
- Molecular Mass ($M_r$) (g/mol)
- Avogadro's Number ($N_a$)
  - 6.023x10^23 atoms/mol
  - The constant seems to be able to be reused everywhere

QUESTION 1:
Calculate the number of atoms in 1g of copper.
$A_r(Cu) = 63.54 g/mol$

1 mol of Cu = 63.54 g
            = $6.023\times10^{23}$

1 g of Cu = $\frac{6.023\times10^{23}}{63.54}$atoms

QUESTION 2:
If there are $3.058\times10^{21}$ atoms present in 1g of gold sample
Determine the atomic mass of gold.

$A_r(Au) = 96.96 g/mol$

QUESTION 3:

A thin gold film (thickness 50nm) was spattered on a smooth Al2O3 substrate (5cm^2). For the total surface area of gold film, calculate
a) Number of gold atoms
b) Moles of gold per unit of surface area

*PVD = PHYSICAL VAPOR DEPOSITION*
*CVD = CHEMICAL VAPOR DEPOSITION*
in spattering chamber

$A_r(Au) = 96.96 g/mol$

m = $4.826\times10^{-4}$g
n = (m * N_A)/A_r
N_A = 6.023\times10^{23} atoms mol^-1
n = 1.476\times 10 ^{18} atoms

b) 4.9 * 10^-7 mol/cm^2

## Classification of structures

1. Macrostructure (1-100um)
2. Microstructure (10-1000nm)
3. Nanostructure (0.1-100nm) (Region is changing due to technology advancement)
4. Short and long range atomic arrangements
    - If we have long repetitions of a basic unit is long range.
    - If material can't endlessly repeat, short range.
5. Atomic structure

## Electronic Structure of the Atom

Electrons occupy discrete energy levels within the atoms

Each e- possesses a particular energy with no more than two eelectrons in each atom having the same energy

### Quantum Numbers

- n Principal quantum number
  - number of 1 means electron is located in 1st shell, 2 is 2nd shell etc
- l Azimuthal quantum number
  - Subshell number
- m_l Magnetic Quantum Number
- m_s Spin quantum number

### Pauli exclusion principle

No more than two electrons with opposing electronic spin may be present in each orbital
SPDF notation

Octet rule: Maximum number of electrons in the outer layer has to be 8 for absolute stability

s: 2, p:6, d: 10, f: 14
n_1: 2, n_2: 8, n_3: 18

```text
1| s
2| s p
3| s p d
4| s p d f
```

ex:
Fe(26): 1s2 2s2 2p6 3s2 3p6 4s2 3d6

### Valence

The number of electrons in an atom that participate in chemical bonding or reactions

Atomic stability
Valence zero

Ar 1s2 2s2 2p6 [3s2 3p6]
  2 + 6 = 8 which means absolute stability

Electronegativity is the tendency of an atom to gain electrons. More electronegative, less likely to release electrons.

## Bonding

### Mechanisms of Bonding

- Metallic
- Covalent
- Ionic
- van der Waals Bond

#### Metallic Bonding

- Low electronegativity
- They "donate" their electrons to form a "sea" of electrons

#### Covalent Bonding

- Particles share valence electrons
- Has to be same type

#### Ionic Bonding

- More than one type of atom is present in material
- Na donates one e- to cl. Na+ and Cl-

#### van der Waals Bonding

- Weakest bond
- Types:
  - London forces
  - Keesom forces
    - H bonding in water
  - Debye forces

### Mixed Bonding

Two or more more types of bonding present in a material

#### Intermetallic compounds

Interaction between 2 metals

- Metallic Bond (Al3V)
- Ionic Bond (LiAl)

#### Ceramic Compounds

- Ionic
- Covalent

$\Delta E$ is the difference in electronegativity

As $\Delta E$ increases, bonding gets more ionic.

Fraction Covalent = $e^{-0.25(\Delta E)^2}$

ex:
Determine the fraction of bonding of Al2O3 that is ionic.

Fraction Covalent = $e^{-0.25(\Delta E)^2}$
Fraction Ionic = 1 - Fraction Covalent

$\Delta E~=~?$

E(Al) = 1.4
E(O) = 3.5

Fraction Covalent = $e^{-0.25(3.5-1.4)^2}$
= 0.3320

Fraction Ionic = 0.668

ex:
Determine if Silica is covalently bonded.

Fraction Covalent = $e^{[-.025(3.5-1.8)]}$
= 0.486

### Binding Energy and Interatomic Spacing

#### Binding Energy

Minimum energy required to create or break the bond

#### Interatomic Spacing

Distance between atoms caused by attraction between the atoms
