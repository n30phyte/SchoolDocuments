## Introduction

Materials Science is a multidisciplinary field

Ex: Silica exists as SiO2, needed material science to turn it into pure Si

### Important Terms

- Composition
  - Refers to elemental composition
    - "What is this shit made of"
  - Water: H2O
  - Alumina: Al2O3
  - Barium Titanate: BaTiO3
- Structure
  - How elements are arranged
  - Different structures have different properties
    - Water can be solid, liquid and gas, different properties
    - Alumina can be transparent, translucent or opaque
      - Transparent one can be used for laser, opaque can be used for dental fillings
    - Different type of copper has different conductivity, etc.
- Synthesis
  - Pure Alumina you use Aluminium and Oxygen
- Processing
  - Purification
    - Natural alumina is poisonous

Materials Science is more for the why behind relations between Properties and Structure, Enginering is for the how.

### Classification of Materials

- Metals
  - High Strength
  - High Stiffness
  - Ductile
  - Electrically and Thermally Conductive
- Ceramics and Glasses
  - Glasses
    - Composed of SiO2, No2O and CaO
    - Optically transparent
    - People in assyria used to know about a glass called royal glass
      - Knowledge was stored in Library of Alexandria
      - It got burned down
      - Used a lot in optoelectronics
  - Ceramics
    - Al2O3, MgO, SiO2, BN, BaTiO2
    - Can store a lot of charge capacitance
      - Used in capacitors
    - YBCO
      - Superconductor
- Polymers
  - Polyethylene
  - Epoxy
  - Phenolics
- Semiconductors
  - Si, Ge
    - Elemental Semiconductors
    - there are other types of non elemental
  - III-V
    - Compound semiconductors, we take a Gr3 and a Gr5 elements.
    - GaAs
      - Direct Bandgap
  - II-VI
    - Gr2 and Gr6 elements
- Composites
  - Use 2 basic materials, mixture, not compound.
  - No chemical reactions
  - Graphite-Epoxy
  - Fiber-Phenolics, Epoxy, Melami-Rubber

## Principles of Basic Chemistry (Revision)

### Structure of the Atom

- Protons, Neutrons, Electrons
  - Electrons must equal Protons
- Atomic Number
  - ex: Atomic Number 26 is Fe
- Atomic Mass ($A_r$) (g/mol)
- Molecular Mass ($M_r$) (g/mol)
- Avogadro's Number ($N_a$)
  - 6.023x10^23 atoms/mol
  - The constant seems to be able to be reused everywhere

QUESTION 1:
Calculate the number of atoms in 1g of copper.
$A_r(Cu) = 63.54 g/mol$

1 mol of Cu = 63.54 g
            = $6.023\times10^{23}$

1 g of Cu = $\frac{6.023\times10^{23}}{63.54}$atoms

QUESTION 2:
If there are $3.058\times10^{21}$ atoms present in 1g of gold sample
Determine the atomic mass of gold.

$A_r(Au) = 96.96 g/mol$

QUESTION 3:

A thin gold film (thickness 50nm) was spattered on a smooth Al2O3 substrate (5cm^2). For the total surface area of gold film, calculate
a) Number of gold atoms
b) Moles of gold per unit of surface area

*PVD = PHYSICAL VAPOR DEPOSITION*
*CVD = CHEMICAL VAPOR DEPOSITION*
in spattering chamber

$A_r(Au) = 96.96 g/mol$

m = $4.826\times10^{-4}$g
n = (m * N_A)/A_r
N_A = 6.023\times10^{23} atoms mol^-1
n = 1.476\times 10 ^{18} atoms

b) 4.9 * 10^-7 mol/cm^2

## Classification of structures

1. Macrostructure (1-100um)
2. Microstructure (10-1000nm)
3. Nanostructure (0.1-100nm) (Region is changing due to technology advancement)
4. Short and long range atomic arrangements
    - If we have long repetitions of a basic unit is long range.
    - If material can't endlessly repeat, short range.
5. Atomic structure

## Electronic Structure of the Atom

Electrons occupy discrete energy levels within the atoms

Each e- possesses a particular energy with no more than two eelectrons in each atom having the same energy

### Quantum Numbers

- n Principal quantum number
  - number of 1 means electron is located in 1st shell, 2 is 2nd shell etc
- l Azimuthal quantum number
  - Subshell number
- m_l Magnetic Quantum Number
- m_s Spin quantum number

### Pauli exclusion principle

No more than two electrons with opposing electronic spin may be present in each orbital
SPDF notation

Octet rule: Maximum number of electrons in the outer layer has to be 8 for absolute stability

s: 2, p:6, d: 10, f: 14
n_1: 2, n_2: 8, n_3: 18

```text
1| s
2| s p
3| s p d
4| s p d f
```

ex:
Fe(26): 1s2 2s2 2p6 3s2 3p6 4s2 3d6

### Valence

The number of electrons in an atom that participate in chemical bonding or reactions

Atomic stability
Valence zero

Ar 1s2 2s2 2p6 [3s2 3p6]
  2 + 6 = 8 which means absolute stability

Electronegativity is the tendency of an atom to gain electrons. More electronegative, less likely to release electrons.
