* Counting and Probability

** Definitions:
- *Random Process* A process where set of possible outcomes must occur, but not sure which one will.
- *Sample Space* a set of all possible outcomes.
- *Event*  a subset of sample space.
   
** Examples:
- 6 Sided die example: Sample space is $\{1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6\}$. Possibility of
   getting 1 or 3 is the subset $\{1, 3\}$
- # of elements in a list: for $m <= n$, there are n-m +1 integers (inclusive)
   in between m and n
- How many 3 digit integers (100-999)?
  - 900 because 999-100 + 1
- How many 3 digits are multiples of 5?
  - 900/5 = 180
- What's the probability that a randomly chosen 3 digit int is a multiple of 5?
  - 180/900
** Permutations
- Permutation of a set of objects is an ordering of them in a row.
- How many ways can the letters in 'James' be arranged in a row? 5!
- # of permutations around a circle: (n-1)!
- # of necklaces that can be made with n beads: $\frac{(n-1)!}{2}$
- r-permutations: An ordered selection of r elements taken from a set of size n
  (rPn).
** Difference Rule
- For two sets A and B, if B subset A, then |A-B| = |A|-|B|
- For integers in 1-1000
  - How many multiples of 5? 200
    - How many multiples of 3? 333
