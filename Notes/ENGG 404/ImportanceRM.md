## Importance of Risk Management

Historically, deaths and injuries were just accepted as part of the job

It is critical to success of projects and job as an engineer.
Avoid loss incidents that result from decisions made without proper risk management

### Calculating IFR

$IFR = \frac{n_{injuries} \times 200000~hours}{Total~exposure~hours}$

## Anatomy of an incident

### Jargon

* Activity: A situation where things are being done, like person doing a job or a task, or a system that does processes.
* Hazards: Things that can do harm, sources of trouble. A slope with loose material or a pressurized material.
* Consequence: How bad things can be if something goes wrong
* Loss Incident: unplanned bad things

### Types of loss incidents

* Occupational hazards and incidents
  * Inherent to task of occupation
* Process hazards and incidents
  * Planning and administration, failure of systems.

### Model 1: no safeguards

* Release or source of energy
* Line of fire
* Inadequate or no safeguards.

### Model 2: Triggering event

* Release or source of energy
* Line of fire
* Trigger

### Ammonia leak at Fernie Memorial Area

* Ammonia leak in Fernie rink
* Ammonia monitoring & alarms
* There was something wrong and workers responded
* Workers had lack of practice
* Refrigeration equipment old, recommended to replace since 6 years before
  * Had brine and ammonia in close proximity, had to keep seperate
* Corrosion due to ammonia, causing it to leak into the brine piping.
* PEAP: Three fatalities, leak of toxic materials, rink unusable and schedule disrupted.

#### Deeper dive

* Process or occupational?
  * A little bit of both.
  * Process: Piping system replacement was recommended
  * OH&S: workers didn't wear PPE
* Which model works best?
  * no safeguards
    * worker didn't use PPE
  * Triggering event
    * Ammonia corrosion
