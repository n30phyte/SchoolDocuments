## Android Development Notes

Android apps have multiple components that can be used as "entry points", and other purposes.

- An activity is a component that provides a UI.
- Other components like broadcast receivers and services allow apps to perform tasks in the background without UI.

Apps can use different components based on the device in use.

An Intent is an object that binds separate components, like two activities.
