## Objects, UML and Java

An important aspect of Object Oriented Programming is **Abstraction**, which helps simplify problems into parts that are simpler to deal with by hiding unnecessary information in the interface.

**Encapsulation** is another aspect, similar to **Abstraction** which hides the internal implementation of the interface/object/feature.

**Decomposition** is the breakdown of a complex design into progressively smaller parts.

**Generalization** is taking commonalities between classes, and then splitting it off into a base class that is extended in the other classes. This reduces code duplication, and allows simpler updating of code, i.e. "Flexible and Extensible".
