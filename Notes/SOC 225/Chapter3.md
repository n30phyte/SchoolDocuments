# Chapter 3

## Criminal Law

1. Federal Legislation
2. Judicial Decisions
    - Interpretation of Legislation
      - Law is written somewhat loosely to allow interpretation by judges.

## Actus Reus and Mens Rea

An accused person may not be convicted of a criminal offence unless the prosecution can prove the following beyond a reasonable doubt:

1. An event was caused by the accused person's conduct (actus reus), and
2. It was done with a certain state of mind (mens rea).

### Actus Reus has 3 components

1. Action or inaction was voluntary
2. Circumstances around the actions
    - Bar fight, if both were consenting, can have an impact.
3. The consequences of the conduct.
    - Consequence came explicity due to conduct
