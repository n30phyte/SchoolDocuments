##### In general

- Argued that we should get rid of this phrase, replace it with the generic word Famicide because it's not "honourable"
- Often other family and community members are involved
  - Sometimes even those in their home countries also involved
- People argue that the label must be kept because it requires different types of intervention, and is not the same as normal homicide
- Those who argue against the term argue that it also adds cultural divides and helps racist views stay
