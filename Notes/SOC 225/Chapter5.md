## Correlates of Criminal Behaviour

- Age
- Gender
- Ethno-racial background
- Socioeconomic Status
- Drug and Alcohol Use
- Location

### Correlation is _NOT_ cause

- No single factor explains crime
- Biggest correlates in Canada are listed below

### Age

- Young people are disproportionately involved in crime, specifically violent crime
  - Most committed are non-violent though
    - Theft, mischief, administration of justice violation (parole etc)
    - Assault 1 is most common
      - No physical harm to victim
    - 12-24 responsible for 40% of homicides
      - More likely against strangers and as a group
- Older people are less likely to commit crime as
  - they are older, less fit
  - Have responsibilities, more reason to conform
  - People depend on us more socially

### Gender

- Males make up majority of criminals and victims

- Women are most commonly found guilty for:
  - Theft
  - Fraud
  - Possession of stolen property
  - Prostitution
  - Failure to appear in court
- More likely than men to be found for:

  - Drug Possession
  - Prostitution

- Heimer and De Coster (1999) tried explaining the gender gap with the following
  - The gender gap is due to culture and position
    - Violent delinquency is due to social learning
    - Girls who accept traditional gender roles are less likely to be involved in violent crime
    - Men are "more aggressive, risk taking physically stronger"
    - Women are "more nurturing, have sexual virtue and female beauty, burdened with ethic of care, able to rely on sex instead of committing crimes"
    - Families are stricter with daughters
    - Violent males are at a larger disadvantage in society, looked down upon more.
- Reena Virk
  - 8 people caught
  - Glowatski and Kelly Ellard charged with Second Degree Murder
  - Bullied due to clothing, weight, and ethnicity
  - Living in group home/foster care
  - Bystander effect
  - Led to national panic regarding youth female violence

  - only 15% of people admitted to prison are women
  - Women less likely to be found guilty of a crime
    - Usually can get their charges withdrawn or stayed
    - Less likely to get jail sentence
    - sentences usually shorter too

#### Moral Panic

- Stanley Cohen
  - looked at the impact media played in shaping public perception on youth crime in England
    - Media used exaggerated stats
  - Certain cases become Folk Devils
  - Moral boundaries made by "people with authority"
  - Experts provide diagnoses and solutions
  - Public projects to every accused
- Further studies noted that panic always directed to youth
  - Cults
  - Gangs
  - Rohypnol
  - Mugging
  - Drug use
- Folk devils usually male
  - unemployed young men
  - African Americans in USA

### Socio-economic status

- Lower classes used to be seen as responsible for crime
  - Referred to as dangerous class, criminal class or underclass
  - Defined as unemployed, in poverty, little education, high dependency, etc.
- Relationship between SES and crime is complicated
  - Low SES overrepresented
  - Different kinds of crime too
    - Very specific to type of crime
    - Different classes have different opportunities to commit different crimes
    - Low income people can't do securities fraud, high income not likely to steal
  - Middle and upper class do similar crimes but unnoticed
  - Three fundemental findings:
    - Link between SES and crime is indirect
      - Neigbhourhood, family
    - Different SES promotes delinquency differently
      - Low: alienation, financial problems, aggression
      - High: less adherence to conventional values, more power and can take more risks with less repercussions

### Location

- Crime found to be higher in communities with more structural disadvantages and lower **collective efficacy**
  - Collective Efficacy:
    - Cohesion among neighbours combined with willingness to intervene
    - Low collective efficacy:
      - High mobility (No permanent house/homeless)
      - Immigration concentration (Everyone don't know each other that much)
      - Concentrated disadvantage (Homeless area)
    - High collective efficacy:
      - People own homes
      - Residents don't change much
      - Old age (Low mobility)
  - Thompson & Gartner found in Toronto:
    - Neighbourhoods with higher rates of Homicide have:
      - Higher levels of unemployment
      - Higher levels of poverty
      - Lower levels of education
  - Indegenous Canadians in cities live in higher crime neighbourhoods
    - More scruntinized by police
    - More reports, more percieved crime
