# Chapter 1

## Criminology

- The body of knowledge regarding crime as a social phenomenon
- Includes the making and breaking of laws, and the sociological reaction.

- Multidisciplinary
  - Even though it is multidisciplinary, each discipline kinda does their own thing.
- We go into Psychological and Biological reasons for crime.

### The Discipline of Criminology

- The definition of Crime and Criminals
  - ex: why is adultery not a crime
- The Origins and Role of the Law
  - ex: Why sodomy was legal until 1969 ehehehehehe
- The Social distribution of crime
  - ex: crime based on race, sex, etc
- Patterns of Criminal Behaviour
  - ex: Certain crime might happen more often at night, in AB

### Criminology vs Criminal Justice Studies

We focus on Criminology, instead of CJS: Sociological reason instead of how it works

### Deviant vs Criminal Acts

- Deviant is behaviour that don't follow norm
- Not all deviant acts are criminal
  - ex: in singapore, you are **legally** bound to save a person from drowning. In Canada, you are not.
- Not all crimes are deviant
  - ex: Illegal to paint a wooden ladder in AB. A long long time ago, you could repaint a ladder to make it look new and trick people to make it seem usable when it's broken.
  - ex: Good Samaritan act: If someone ODs on drugs, and you call the police, you won't be charged

### Regulation of Behaviour

- Most of us conform to the norms of society
  - Norms: established standards of behavious mantained by a society
    - Informal: unwritten rules
    - Formal: Laws

### Why study crime

- To better understand crime, criminal behaviour and society's response to it.
- Crime affects us all, directly or indirectly.
  - Indirectly: tax to pay for police, etc.
  - ex: Municipal tax: 16.6% of tax goes to police
- To reduce crime, we must first understand it.

### What is Crime

- We use a legal defintion of crime, instead of Human Rights or Moral definition.
  - A crime is an act that violates criminal law and is punishable through the law.

### Human Rights Violations As Crime

Schwendinger (1970) proposed a broader definition of crime based on Human Rights violations

We could charge government for neglecting people, cars that pollute too much.

### Maslow's Hierarchy of Needs

Unless things on the bottom of the pyramid are met, the ones above will not matter for the person.

### Hagen's (1985) Continuum of Crime and Deviance

- Reflects the way most criminologists think of crime
- falls somehwere between legalistic and human rights
- Crime encompasses acts that break criminal law and a range of behaviours.
  - Consensus Crime like murder, treason
  - Conflict Crime like prostitution
  - Social Deviations (not crimes) like Skateboards, bicycle and scooters on the sidewalk.
  - Social Diversions (not crime) going topless outside

### Crime as a Social Construct

- There are no universally condemened acts
- What is considered a crime changes over time
- The distinction between criinal and non-criminal is sometimes ambiguous

### Tracy Latimer (1980-1993)

- She was born in 1980 with Cerebral Palsy
- She suffered a sever oxygen deprivation during birth, which is what caused it.
- She is unable to walk or talk, needs help with feeding, and she has severe epilepsy.
- They had to do a surgery to take part of her leg out to help her with her pain.
- Her dad killed her in a "mercy killing" by using carbon monoxide to poison her.
- He was charged 2nd degree murder.
- At 1993, most Canadians agreed Robert Latimer should not have been put into jail.

### Who Constructs Laws on Crime?

- Two main theories: Consensus Theories and Conflict Theories

#### Consensus Theories

- Social solidarity, collective consciousness and social collectivism
- Argues that there is a consesus across Canadians on what things are illegal, and that's where laws are based from.

##### Structural Functionalism

- A form of Consensus Theory.
- Laws reflect something natural.
- Laws are made for social stability and cohesion.

- Emile Durkheim is a big figure in Functionalism
  - Was inspired by an Australian tribe with how stable and cohesive they were due to how codependent they were. Everyone had a role.
  - He returned to France, determined to understand suicide in France.
    - He went to churches that kept records of deaths, and stuided them.
    - *The phrase commit suicide came from the fact that suicide was a crime.*
    - He noticed that Men died by suicide more often, Protestant more often than Catholics, rates lower during war than during peace, singles higher than married.
    - The factors intersected with his idea of social cohesion
      - Females were more emotionally invested to the family, while men felt more independent.
      - Protestants are less connected to the church, while catholicism promotes more church based things.
      - People were more connected during war and other crises.
  - Anomie is a term he made
    - "I don't feel connected to my society"
    - Everyone is in their own bubble
    - Since 1970s into 1990, neoliberalism promoted indivudal needs over the needs of the society. Durkheim predicted a higher level of Anomie.
  - Argues crime is functional and normal
    - Courts are like a theatre stage, showing Canadian values at play.
    - Courts also allow for changes to the law, improving on society.

#### Conflict Theories

- Our laws do not reflect a consensus of Canadian values, but reflect the conflict between certain powerful groups vs less powerful groups.
- The law is a tool by the capitalists to ensure their interests are protected.
- Attributed to Karl Marx
  - Upton Sinclair: The Jungle
  - He noticed the exploitation of the workers by the bourgoisie
  - Alienation
    - He argued that the capitalist system alienated people from the product of the labor (division of labor).
      - If you made the table yourself, you feel pride in it
      - If you bought a table, someone else did it.
- Antonio Gramsci
  - Italian marxist
  - While in prison he reflected on Marx's works.
  - Hegemony
    - We have come to believe that even though we are exploited/alienated, it's natural/in our best interests.
      - Media is owned by the capitalists, which only show us what they want to show us.
      - Family pushes capitalism: get allowance for doing work.
- Ralf Dahrendorf
  - Many more people have a stake in the capitalist system (Savings in the bank)
    - We would be hurt if the system changed
  - There was an overall increase in the standard of living due to it
    - Less reason for people to start a revolution, people are comfortable.
  - Unions and organized labor gave us comforts
    - 40 hr work weeks
    - Worker's compensation if you injured yourself due to your job.
    - Minimum wage
