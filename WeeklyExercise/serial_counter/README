Weekly Exercise 6: Serial Counter

Included Files:
- README
- Makefile
- serial_counter.cpp

Accessories:
- Arduino Mega 2560
- 5 LEDs
- 5 560 Ohm Resistors
- Breakout wires

Wiring instructions:
- Arduino Pin 9 <-> Long LED lead |LED| Short LED lead <-> 560 Ohm Resistor <-> GND
- Repeat above for pin 10 until 13

Running instructions:
1. Connect the Arduino to the PC using an A-B USB cable. Ensure that the Arduino is on the right port.
2. In the folder with counting.cpp, Makefile and README, execute `make upload && serial-mon`
3. Wait until "Ready for input." shows up in the terminal.
4. Input any number and any character from A-F, case insensitive, to produce a running count on the screen and output to LED.
4. Use space or enter to reset the count.

Notes and Assumptions:
- Global constants were used in this project.
- Keys that get read as control codes in minicom will affect the total incorrectly.
  - Up/Down/Left/Right, function keys.
- Tabs were not mentioned as a reset in the instructions. It will be ignored.
