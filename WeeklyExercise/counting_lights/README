Weekly Exercise 5: Counting Lights

Included Files:
- README
- Makefile
- counting.cpp

Accessories:
- Arduino Mega 2560
- 3 Buttons
- 5 LEDs
- 5 560 Ohm Resistors
- Breakout wires

Wiring instructions:
- Arduino Pin 9 <-> Resistor <-> Long LED lead |LED| Short LED lead <-> 360 Ohm Resistor <-> GND
- Repeat above for pin 10 until 13
- Arduino Pin 5 <-> |Button| <-> GND
- Repeat above for pin 6 and 7

Running instructions:
1. Connect the Arduino to the PC using an A-B USB cable. Ensure that the Arduino is using the proper serial port (/dev/ttyACM0 or /dev/ttyACM1)
2. In the folder with counting.cpp, Makefile and README, execute `make upload && serial-mon`
3. The button connected to pin 7 is for incrementing
4. The button connected to pin 6 is for decrementing
5. the button connected to pin 5 is for loading and storing
  
Notes and Assumptions:
- Global constants were used in this project
- Pin was set to INPUT_PULLUP mode was using built in arduino feature instead of writing HIGH to input pins (Requires Arduino 1.0.1 or above)
