Weekly Exercise 1: Password Validator

List flattening using list comprehension was taken from
https://stackoverflow.com/questions/952914/how-to-make-a-flat-list-out-of-list-of-lists

Running instructions:
  1. Fill out the main function with whatever code that uses the generator or validator
  2. Execute `python3 validator.py` in the command line

Notes and Assumptions:
  The file contains 2 functions called `validate` and `generate`. `validate` can be called with any string, `generate` is always called with an integer that is larger than or equal to 8
  The functions assume that all strings are ASCII, no Unicode. Unicode might work, but is untested. Maximum values should be the same as python maximum values.
