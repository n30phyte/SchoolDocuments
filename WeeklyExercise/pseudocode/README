Weekly Exercise 3: Pseudocode to Code

Included Files:
- README
- flipflop.cpp
- textmatch.cpp
- Makfile

Running instructions:
1. `make` could be used to build both assignments, `make flipflop` can be used to make just flipflop and `make textmatch` for just textmatch.
2. Run the program with either `./flipflop` or `./textmatch`.
3. Type in the required information for each.
4. `make clean` will delete all non-source files.

Notes and Assumptions:
- Compiler is C++ 11 compliant.
