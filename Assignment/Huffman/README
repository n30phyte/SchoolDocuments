HUFFMAN ASSIGNMENT: NEW VERSION FOR FALL 2019

STUDENTS SHOULD REPLACE THIS README WITH THEIR OWN

Included Files:
- bitio.py: Contains the classs BitWriter and BitReader
- compress.py: Runs the code to compress a file.
- huffman.py: Used to create huffman trees as well as encode and decode messages. To be written in class.
- webserver.py: The file that allows viewing of the compressed files as they are being sent to the web browser
- wwwroot directory: contains compressed versions of the webpage (index.html.huf) and the image of Huffman (huffman.bmp.huf)

Modified Files:
- util.py: Contains the five functions read_tree(), decode_byte(), write_tree(), compress(), and decompress() which students must implement.

Running the code:
Go to the wwwroot directory. Open a bash terminal and open the web server using "python3 ../webserver.py". You can then go to the url "http://localhost:8000" to view the webpage and image of Huffman that will appear if the decompressor is functioning properly. Note that the port can be changed by modifying the variable port in webserver.py.

To compress a file, first copy that file over to the wwwroot directory and then move to that directory and type "python3 ../compress.py somefile.ext" where somefile is the name of the file you wish to compress and ext is the extension. Then go to the url "http://localhost:8000/somefile.ext" to view and/or download the decompressed file.
