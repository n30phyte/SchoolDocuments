Assignment 1: Huffman Coding

Running instructions:
  - To use the decompressor:
    - Execute `python3 ../webserver.py` in the command line from inside the wwwroot folder
    - or call `util.decompress(compressed, uncompressed)` where compressed and uncompressed binary file streams
  - To use the compressor:
    - Execute `python3 ../compressor.py <file1> [file2] [file...]` in the command line from inside the wwwroot folder
    - or call `util.compress(tree, uncompressed, compressed)` where compressed and uncompressed binary file streams and tree is the huffman tree of the file.

Notes and Assumptions:
  - Using Python iter() to replace a while loop to make code look cleaner. https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html#iter
    - Idea to use lambda from: https://stackoverflow.com/a/9815824
