Weekly Exercise 2: Unfair Dice

Running instructions:
  1. Fill out the main function with whatever code that uses the generator or validator
  2. Execute `python3 unfairDice.py` in the command line

Notes and Assumptions:
  Code is run with at least Python 3.6 to support 'f-strings' https://docs.python.org/3/whatsnew/3.6.html
  Assuming Python's `random` is platform independent, results should be the same everywhere.
