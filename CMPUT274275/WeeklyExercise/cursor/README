Weekly Exercise 1: Display and Joystick

Included Files:
- README
- Makefile
- joy_cursor.cpp

Accessories:
- Arduino Mega 2560
- 1 Joystick
- Breakout wires
- SD Card with correct data.

Wiring instructions:
- Arduino Pin A9 <-> Joystick VRx
- Arduino Pin A8 <-> Joystick VRy
- Arduino GND <-> Joystick GND
- Arduino 5V <-> Joystick +5V

Running instructions:
1. Connect the Arduino to the PC using an A-B USB cable. Ensure that the correct Arduino is selected with `arduino-port-select`.
2. In the folder with joy_cursor.cpp, Makefile and README, run `make upload-0`
3. Wait until the map fully draws out with the cursor before using.

Notes and Assumptions:
- Global constants were used in this project.
- VRx input was inverted in code due to my joystick having inverted axis (joystick left = map right)
- Cursor glitchy during movement, but not when at rest.
- SD Card is properly flashed and working.
- Starter code provided was used.
