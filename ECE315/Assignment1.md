1. A deterministic  response time allows specifications to be made, and no surprises when the system is used. This is extremely important for embedded systems where it might be deployed on oil rigs and other safety critical applications.

2. Cloud computing is the idea that theres a group of computer systems hosted that you can make use of on demand, where instead of having companies purchase and mantain their own equipment in their own data centers or premises, they can pay for another company that can dedicate their time and money into the maintenance and development of cloud related technologies, while client companies pay for computing time/storage space.

3. Git operations
   1. git add: Adds new files to get tracked by the repository.
   2. git commit: Commits the changes in the files into the repository.
   3. git push: Pushes changes to a remote repository.
   4. git pull: Pulls all changes from remote repository into local.
   5. git checkout: Checkout or switch to a specified branch.
   6. git merge: Merges a branch into another one.
4. Pointers
   1. Set pointers to automatically check for null pointers
   2. Bounds checking before allowing access
   3. Use an automatic reference counting pointer like Arc<> in Rust or std::shared_ptr<> in C++
   4. Keep track of allocation status on the pointer.
   5. In an embedded system, the solutions all require more RAM and more processing time.
