The vector $w_i$ will contain one entry for each pixel in the flattened image. That way, if an image $x$ contains the digit $i$, then the hypothesis $h_{w_i}(x)$ should produce a number close to $1$; the operation should produce a number close to $0$ if image $x$ does not contain digit $i$. \n","\n","$h_{w_i}$ is defined as follows for Linear Regression :\n","\n","\\begin{equation*}\n","h_{w_i} = w_i \\cdot x + b\n","\\end{equation*}\n","\n","While it is defined as follows for Logistic Regression:\n","\n","\\begin{equation*}\n","h_{w_i} = g(w_i \\cdot x + b)\\,.\n","\\end{equation*}\n","where $g$ is the logistic function $\\frac{1}{1 + e^{-z}}$.\n","\n","Given an image $x$, our model predicts digit $i$ for the largest value returned by $h_{w_i}$ for all $i$. For example, if we pass the first image of the training data x_train[0] to the model, then the model will predict the digit 5 correctly if the output of the functions $h_{w_i}$ are similar to the following (these are made-up numbers to illustrate the procedure).\n","\n","\\begin{align*}\n","h_{w_0} &= 0.1 \\\\\n","h_{w_1} &= 0.01 \\\\\n","h_{w_2} &= 0.05 \\\\\n","h_{w_3} &= 0.25 \\\\\n","h_{w_4} &= 0.40 \\\\\n","h_{w_5} &= 0.95 \\\\\n","h_{w_6} &= 0.80 \\\\\n","h_{w_7} &= 0.12 \\\\\n","h_{w_8} &= 0.71 \\\\\n","h_{w_9} &= 0.01 \\\\\n","\\end{align*}\n","\n","Since $h_{w_5}$ is the largest value, the model will predict that the image is of the digit 5.\n","\n","We will use the training data (variables images and labels) to discover vectors $w_i$ and scalars $b_i$ that classify most of the training data correctly. This will be achieved by defining an error function and then applying gradient descent to minimize the error. We will adjust the values of $w_i$ and $b_i$ to reduce the error for each function $h_{w_i}$. \n","\n","Let $y$ be the label of an image $x$ for a specific function $h_{w_i}$. $y = 0$ if $x$ does not contain the digit $i$ and $y = 1$ otherwise. We will use the Mean Squared Error (MSE) loss function $J(w_i)$ for Linear Regression and one of the versions of Logistic Regression. MSE is defined as follows, where $m$ is the number of training instances. \n","\\begin{equation*}\n","J(w_i) = \\frac{1}{2m} \\sum_{x, y} (h_{w_i}(x) - y)^2\n","\\end{equation*}\n","As an example, if $h_{w_i}(x) = 0.95$ for an image that does not contain digit $i$, then the error for this particular image will be $(0.95 - 0)^2 = 0.9025$; if $h_{w_i}(x) = 0$, then the error would have been zero for this instance. The positive error informs gradient descent that the values of $w_i$ need to be adjusted to reduce the error.  \n","\n","<h3>Gradient Descent</h3>\n","\n","We will initialize the values of $w_i$ with random values close to zero (this is already implemented for you) and $b$ with zeros and then adjust them according to gradient descent. \n","\n","Let $w_{i, j}$ be the $j$-th value of the vector $w_i$ for digit $i$. The value of $w_{i, j}$ and $b_i$ will be modified according to gradient descent (see equations below), where $\\alpha$ is a small value indicating the size of the step performed by gradient descent. Recall from the lectures that if $\\alpha$ is large gradient descent might fail to find the minimum of the error function. We will use $\\alpha = 0.05$ in our experiments. \n","\n","Gradient descent uses the two equations below for Linear Regression and the two versions of Logistic Regression you will implement. \n","\n","\\begin{align*}\n","w_{i, j} &= w_{i, j} - \\alpha \\frac{\\partial J(w_i)}{\\partial w_{i, j}} \\text{ for all }j \\\\\n","b &= b - \\alpha \\frac{\\partial J(w_i)}{\\partial b}\n","\\end{align*}\n","\n","If implemented correctly, the equations above finds values of $w_i$ and $b_i$ that correctly classify at least 85\\% of the test data. The problem with the approach described is that we need to implement 10 different functions, one for each digit. This is not only time consuming but also computationally expensive. Instead, we will discuss a vectorized version of the algorithm described above. \n","\n","<h3> Vectorized Implementation </h3>\n","\n","In our vectorized implementation the model will produce a vector as output, with one entry for each digit. This way we will not need to implement one function $h_{w_i}$ for each digit, we will implement a single function $h_{W}$ for all digits, where $W$ is a matrix containing all vectors $w_i$ as row vectors. In addition to the matrix $W$, we will use a vector $B$ with one entry for each digit. The input images will be provided as a matrix $X$ with one flattened image in each column of $X$. \n","\n","The labels will also be provided as a matrix $Y$ of shape $(10, m)$, where $m$ is the number of instances in the training set. Each column of $Y$ is a one-hot vector (i.e., a vector with one entry equals $1$ and all other entries equal $0$). The entry with value of $1$ in a one-hot vector indicates the digit of the image. \n","\n","Here are all matrices we will use in our vectorized representation.\n","\n","\\begin{align*}\n","X =& \n"," \\begin{bmatrix}\n"," p_{0,0} &  p_{0, 1} & \\cdots &  p_{0, m-1} \\\\\n"," p_{1, 0} &  p_{1,1} & \\cdots &  p_{1, m-1} \\\\\n"," \\cdots & \\cdots & \\cdots & \\cdots \\\\\n","  p_{783, 0} &  p_{783, 1} & \\cdots &  p_{783, m-1} \\\\\n","\\end{bmatrix} \\\\\n","W =& \n"," \\begin{bmatrix}\n","w_{0,0} & w_{0,1} & \\cdots & w_{0,783} \\\\\n","w_{1,0} & w_{1,1} & \\cdots & w_{1,783} \\\\\n","\\cdots & \\cdots & \\cdots & \\cdots \\\\\n","w_{9,0} & w_{9,1} & \\cdots & w_{9,783} \\\\\n","\\end{bmatrix} \\\\\n","B =& \n"," \\begin{bmatrix}\n","b_0 \\\\\n","b_1 \\\\\n","\\cdots \\\\\n","b_9\n","\\end{bmatrix} \\\\\n","Y =& \n"," \\begin{bmatrix}\n"," y_{0,0} &  y_{0, 1} & \\cdots &  y_{0, m-1} \\\\\n"," y_{1, 0} &  y_{1,1} & \\cdots &  y_{1, m-1} \\\\\n"," \\cdots & \\cdots & \\cdots & \\cdots \\\\\n","  y_{9, 0} &  y_{9, 1} & \\cdots & y_{9, m-1} \\\\\n","\\end{bmatrix} \\\\\n","\\end{align*}\n","\n","<h4>Forward Propagation</h4>\n","\n","Using the matrices above we can predict the label of all instances in a data set by performing the operation $\\hat{Y} = W.$dot$(X) + B$ for Linear Regression and the operation $\\hat{Y} = g(W.$dot$(X) + B)$ for Logistic Regression. The largest number in each column of matrix $\\hat{Y}$ will indicate the predicted label. \n","\n","\n","<h4>Backward Propagation</h4>\n","\n","Let $E = \\hat{Y} - Y$ be the matrix with the pure errors. The gradients of the bias terms can be computed by adding all column vectors of $E$, while the gradients for the weights can be computed as $E.dot(X.T)$. The average value is computed by dividing the values obtained with the operations above by $m$. We can now apply Gradient Descent by making a small step in the opposite direction of the gradients.
