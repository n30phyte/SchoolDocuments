    Class to represent a state on grid-based pathfinding problems. The class contains two static variables:

    in the CLOSED list. 

    Each state has the values of x, y, g, h, and cost. The cost is used as the criterion for sorting the nodes
    in the OPEN list for both Dijkstra's algorithm and A*. For Dijkstra the cost should be the g-value, while
    for A* the cost should be the f-value of the node.
