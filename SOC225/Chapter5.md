## Correlates of Criminal Behaviour

- Age
- Gender
- Ethno-racial background
- Socioeconomic Status
- Drug and Alcohol Use
- Location

### Correlation is _NOT_ cause

- No single factor explains crime
- Biggest correlates in Canada are listed below

### Age

- Young people are disproportionately involved in crime, specifically violent crime
  - Most committed are non-violent though
    - Theft, mischief, administration of justice violation (parole etc)
    - Assault 1 is most common
      - No physical harm to victim
    - 12-24 responsible for 40% of homicides
      - More likely against strangers and as a group
- Older people are less likely to commit crime as
  - they are older, less fit
  - Have responsibilities, more reason to conform
  - People depend on us more socially

### Gender

- Males make up majority of criminals and victims

- Women are most commonly found guilty for:
  - Theft
  - Fraud
  - Possession of stolen property
  - Prostitution
  - Failure to appear in court
- More likely than men to be found for:

  - Drug Possession
  - Prostitution

- Heimer and De Coster (1999) tried explaining the gender gap with the following
  - The gender gap is due to culture and position
    - Violent delinquency is due to social learning
    - Girls who accept traditional gender roles are less likely to be involved in violent crime
    - Men are "more aggressive, risk taking physically stronger"
    - Women are "more nurturing, have sexual virtue and female beauty, burdened with ethic of care, able to rely on sex instead of committing crimes"
    - Families are stricter with daughters
    - Violent males are at a larger disadvantage in society, looked down upon more.
- Reena Virk
  - 8 people caught
  - Glowatski and Kelly Ellard charged with Second Degree Murder
  - Bullied due to clothing, weight, and ethnicity
  - Living in group home/foster care
  - Bystander effect
  - Led to national panic regarding youth female violence

  - only 15% of people admitted to prison are women
  - Women less likely to be found guilty of a crime
    - Usually can get their charges withdrawn or stayed
    - Less likely to get jail sentence
    - sentences usually shorter too

#### Moral Panic

- Stanley Cohen
  - looked at the impact media played in shaping public perception on youth crime in England
    - Media used exaggerated stats
  - Certain cases become Folk Devils
  - Moral boundaries made by "people with authority"
  - Experts provide diagnoses and solutions
  - Public projects to every accused
- Further studies noted that panic always directed to youth
  - Cults
  - Gangs
  - Rohypnol
  - Mugging
  - Drug use
- Folk devils usually male
  - unemployed young men
  - African Americans in USA

### Socio-economic status

- Lower classes used to be seen as responsible for crime
  - Referred to as dangerous class, criminal class or underclass
  - Defined as unemployed, in poverty, little education, high dependency, etc.
- Relationship between SES and crime is complicated
  - Low SES overrepresented
  - Different kinds of crime too
    - Very specific to type of crime
    - Different classes have different opportunities to commit different crimes
    - Low income people can't do securities fraud, high income not likely to steal
  - Middle and upper class do similar crimes but unnoticed
  - Three fundemental findings:
    - Link between SES and crime is indirect
      - Neigbhourhood, family
    - Different SES promotes delinquency differently
      - Low: alienation, financial problems, aggression
      - High: less adherence to conventional values, more power and can take more risks with less repercussions

### Location

- Crime found to be higher in communities with more structural disadvantages and lower **collective efficacy**
  - Collective Efficacy:
    - Cohesion among neighbours combined with willingness to intervene
    - Low collective efficacy:
      - High mobility (No permanent house/homeless)
      - Immigration concentration (Everyone don't know each other that much)
      - Concentrated disadvantage (Homeless area)
    - High collective efficacy:
      - People own homes
      - Residents don't change much
      - Old age (Low mobility)
  - Thompson & Gartner found in Toronto:
    - Neighbourhoods with higher rates of Homicide have:
      - Higher levels of unemployment
      - Higher levels of poverty
      - Lower levels of education
  - Indegenous Canadians in cities live in higher crime neighbourhoods
    - More scruntinized by police
    - More reports, more percieved crime

### Ethno-racial background

- Data on race and crime is limited
  - Police reports rarely include
- Opposition on race data collection
  - Police can't identify race properly
  - Can be used by racists
- Pro on race data collection
  - Verify accuracy of differential treatment
  - Could be used to test theories that relate race with crime
  - Racists will be racists
- Data does exist, suggests police discrimination
- Overrepresentation present in all Western countries
- Canada specifically:
  - Black Canadians out east
    - 3% of population, 10% of federal inmates
    - Believed by correctional staff to be part of gang
    - More likely to:
      - Experience use of force
      - Receive more charges while in prison
      - Denied parole despite lower return rates
      - Get racially profiled
    - Differential Treatment Hypothesis
      - Police often give closer attention to specific groups
      - Surveillance higher in communities with lower social ability
      - Race and ethnicity affects police's discretion in wether or not to arrest someone
        - Police are primary point of contact between people and the cjs
        - Can do a lot to introduce people into the system
  - Indigenous Canadians in west
    - 25% of males and 33% of females federal inmates
      - They're only 5% of total population
    - Number of Aboriginal people increased 46% in last 10 years
      - Prison population only went up 17%
      - Women increased by 80%
    - Possible Structural Theories
      1. Canadians have institutionalized the alienation of indegenous peoples
      2. Historic trauma makes indegenous peoples feel more helpless against the system
      3. CJS reflects the norms of the dominant group
        - Indegenous and Western norms different
   - Truth and Reconciliation Comissions
     - Independent body made to proivde former students and anyone affected by Residential Schools a safe space.
       - It was mandated to gather archives, educate Canadians and improve reconciliation.

### Drug and Alcohol Misuse

- Use of illicit drugs strongly correlates with street crime
  - 75% of inmates get in due to substance abuse
  - 50% of inmates struggle with substance addiction
- Alcohol consumptions correlates with social harms, including violence
- Supporting an addiction can lead to economically compulsive actions such as crime
- Psychotic drugs could influence individuals to commit crime
- Possessoin is a crime
