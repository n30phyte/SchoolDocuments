## The Social Context of Dispute Settlement and the Rise of Law

- How laws came to be, and the historical social contexts when it was introduced.

### Lenski's Classification of Societies based on Mode of Production

1. Hunting and Gathering
   - Only in the last 100 years
2. Pastoral
   - Sheperds
3. Horticultural
   - Cultivating your own food in a garden
4. Agricultural
   - Horticultural x10 due to technology
5. Industrial
   - Factories, etc.

### Small Scale Societies

- Hundreds of years ago, most people would be nomadic.
  - Whenever food supplies run out, you would just move somewhere else where there's more food.
- There was no surplus, stratification or states
  - No way to store food, so you just killed what you need.
  - No heirarchy, everyone was equal.
  - No state, no government, no rules.
- There would have been a lot of conflict
  - Fight over food, women
- The general policy was: the more people the better
- So instead of kicking people out of your tribe, it would be in your best interest to settle disputes
  - Restores relationships
    - Self-based redress
      - You stole from x, you guys figure it out
    - Kin-based redress
      - Figure it out between your families
      - "My sister stole from your son."
    - Advisory-based redress
      - "Dear elder tell us what should we do for this problem"
- Eventually we were able to store/preserve food
  - Pemmican
- People started to stay in the same places, rarely needing to move.
  - Hunt in the morning come back at afternoon.
- Some people would have had more children, allowing them to build more buildings (towns/cities)
- This started the idea of private property, villages, marking territories.
- If someone chose a place closer to a river, they could grow more food.
  - They would be more powerful, cos they get to control the food supply.

### Feudalism

- Peasants did work for the Lords who gave them protection through Knights

#### Downfall of Feudalism

[TODO: DON'T FORGET TO FILL THIS OUT]

#### The Rise of the Merchant CLass-1600s

- The volume of trade, longer distances, and joint ventures required a system of law and a court system to enforce it.
  - The merchants asked the king for protecton and capital, in exchange for new places to claim.
- Legal contracts and lawyers grew in importance
  - If you don't bring back x, you're going to court.
- Allowed the Crown to consolidate power, in exchange for legislation and enforcement that favoured merchants.
- The growth of Commerce, money and banking resulted in transactions governed by law instead of custom

#### Jacques Rolland

- Went to Eastern Canada as a clerk
- Asked his boss if he could join one of the expeditions.

- Rolland asked for capital to start a warehouse in Louisbourg.
  - Stored supplies year round.
- He needed somoene older than 25 to sign the contract.
- He met a family in Louisburg who asked him to marry their daughter to get the contract signed.
- After the marriage broke down, his inventory was confiscated.
- Inventory was auctioned to pay off debt.
- Rolland was imprisoned during that time, and disappeared after.

#### Contemporary State Power A Crisis in State Legitimacy

- Laws are only effective if people respect the law, and legitimacy of the state.
- If people stop believing in the above, then we will fall into a crisis of legitimacy
  - The state no longer is able to mantain the authority o govern
    - French Revolution
  - Transnational Corporations are very powerful and important special interest groups
    - They have power to influence state policies and laws
    - A lot of economic power, difficult to regulate
    - Companies just move to another country if your country too strict
    - Example:
      - Opioid Crisis
