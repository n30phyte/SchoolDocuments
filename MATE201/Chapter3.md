# Chapter 3

## Atomic and Ionic arrangements

- No Order
- Short Range Order
  - In a small region, there is a repetition of shape, but might not have a pattern
- Long Range Order
  - The shape is regular for the entire material, with a pattern.
  - Structure is in unit cells.

## Crystalline Materials

- If a crystalline material consists of only one large crystal
  - Si Chips
  - Electrooptical devices
  - LiN6O3
- Poly crystalline Materials
- Many small crystals with different orientations in the plane.

### Liquid Crystals

- Usually polyermic materials that behave as amorphous in one state
- They change allignments under external stimulus (E Field or Temperature)

## Lattice, Unit Cells, Basis and Crystal Structures

### Lattice

A collection of points arranged in a periodic pattern, so the surroundings of the point is identical

### Basis or Motif

A group of one or more atoms located inside a lattice point
