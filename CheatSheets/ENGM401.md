## Ratio Analysis

- Capital is from debt and equity
  - Debt is from bank, equity is from owners
- Ratios
  - Debt ratio: $\frac{Total~Debt}{Total~Assets}$
  - Times Interest Earned: $\frac{Taxable~Income}{Interest}$
  - Current: $\frac{Assets}{Liabilities}$
  - Quick: $\frac{Assets-Inventory}{Liabilities}$
  - Inventory Turnover: $\frac{Sales}{Average~Inventory}$
  - Day Sales Outstanding: $\frac{Receivables}{Avg~Sales/day}$
  - Total Asset Turnover: $\frac{Sales}{Total~Assets}$
  - Profit Margin on Sales: $\frac{Net~Income}{Revenue}$
  - Return on Assets: $\frac{Net~Income + Interest(1-Tax~rate)}{Avg~Total~Assets}$
  - Return on Equity: $\frac{Net~Income}{Avg~Total~Equity}$
  - Earnings Per Share: $\frac{Net~Income}{Common~Shares~Outstanding}$
  - Price to Earnings: $\frac{Price~Per~Share}{Earnings~Per~Share}$
  - Book Value Per Share: $\frac{Total~Equity - Preferred~Stock}{Shares~Outstanding}$

## Interest Rates

Effective Annual Interest Rate
$i_a = (1+\frac{r}{M})^M -1$
$i_a$: **Effective Annual** interest rate
$M$: Compounding periods
$r$: **Nominal** interest rate

Effective Interest Rate per Payment Period
$i = (1+\frac{r}{M})^C -1$
$M = CK$
$i$: **Effective** interest rate
$M$: **Compounding** periods per **year**
$C$: **Compounding** periods per **payment period**
$K$: **Payment** periods per **year**
$r$: **Nominal** interest rate

Continuous Compounding:
$i_a = e^r - 1$
$i = e^\frac{r}{k} - 1$

## Loans

- Components of loan
  - $A$: Annual payments
  - $B_N$: Remaining balance at period $N$, $B_0 = P$, $B_N = A(P/A, i, N-n)$
  - $I_N$: Interest part of payment at period $N$. $I_N = B_{N-1} i$
  - $PP_N$: Principal Payment at period $N$
  - $A = PP_N + I_N$
- Mortgages are special loans, usually compounded semi-anually

## Bonds

- Components
  - Par value: Face value
  - Maturity date: When the par value gets repaid
  - Coupon rate: Interest rate
  - Cheap Bond = Discount. Expensive = Premium.
  - Yield to maturity = ROI
    - $A(P/A, i, N) + PV(P/F, i, N)$
  - Current yield: annual interest per market price:
    - $\frac{i}{Purchase}$

## Depreciation

- Book Depreciation
  - Straight Line
    - $D = \frac{P-S}{N}$, $BV_n = P-nD$
  - Declining Balance
    - $D_n = dP(1-d)^{n-1}$, $BV_n = P(1-d)^n$, $d = \frac{1}{N} or \frac{2}{N}$
  - SOYD
    - $S_{years} = \frac{N(N+1)}{2}$, $D_n = \frac{N-n+1}{S_{years}}(P-S)$
  - UP
    - $D_n = \frac{Units/year}{TotalUnits}(P-S)$
- Tax Depreceiation
  - Overhauls are considered a seperate asset

## Taxation

[comment]: # (Continue with Presentation 27)
[comment]: # (TODO: Disposal tax effects)

- Disposal Tax Effects
  - Cost > Salvage > UCC: $G = t(UCC_N - S)$
  - Cost > UCC > Salvage: Same as above
  - Salvage > Cost > UCC: $G = t(UCC_N - P) - 0.5t(S-P)$
  - $NS = S + G$
  - $NS$: Net Salvage Value, $G$: Disposal Tax Effect, $S$: Salvage Value, $P$: Principal
