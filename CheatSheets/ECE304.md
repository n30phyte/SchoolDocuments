## Basic Electrical Formulae

$$
V = IR\\
I = C \frac{dV}{dt}\\
Q = C V
$$

## Logical Effort

### Single Stage

- $d = f + p$
  - Where $d$ is total delay, $f$ is stage effort and $p$ is parasitic delay.
- $f = gh$
  - $g$ is logical effort and $h$ is electrical effort.
- $C_{in, inv} = (\mu + 1)\text{C}$
- $C_{in, NAND} = (N + \mu)\text{C}$
- $C_{in, NOR} = (N \mu + 1)\text{C}$
- $h = C_{out} / C_{in}$
- $g_{inv} = 1$
- $g_{gate} = C_{in, gate} / C_{in, inv}$
- $b = \frac{C_{on} + C_{off}}{C_{on}}$

### Multi Stage

- $G = \Pi g$
- $B = \Pi b$
- $H = \Pi h \text{ or } C_{out} / C_{in, first~gate}$
- $F = GBH \text{ or } \Pi f$
- $D = \Sigma(gbh + p)$
- $P$ can be estimated by counting the number of inputs of the gates in the critical path.

#### Minimum Path Delay

- $P = \Sigma p$
- $D_{min} = N F^{1/N} + P$

### Ratioed Logic

- Pseudo-NMOS
  - Low to High: Find inverter equivalent to the pull up PMOS
  - High to Low: Calculate net current difference from both the PUN and PDN, find equivalent inverter and use for $C_{in, inv}$

## Memory

### DRAM

- Read
  - $V_{bitline} = V_{DD}/2$
  - During read, the charge stored in the capacitor flows out and gets shared with the bitline.
- Write
  - $V_{bitline} = V_{DD} \text{ or } 0$
  - During write, storage capacitor gets charged or discharged accordingly until it reaches bitline voltage.

### ROM

- NOR ROM array
  - NMOS connected to GND for 0, straight line for 1.
- NAND ROM array
  - NMOS connected downwards for 1, straight line for 0.
